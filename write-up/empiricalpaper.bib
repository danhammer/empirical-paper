abstract = {The effect of insecure ownership on ordinary investment
                  and natural resource use is examined. Insecure
                  ownership is postulated to depend on the type of
                  government regime in power and the prevalence of
                  political violence or instability. The political
                  determinants of economywide investment are estimated
                  from cross-country data, and the results are used to
                  form an index of ownership security. When introduced
                  into empirical models of natural resource use, this
                  index has a significant and quantitatively important
                  effect on the use of forests and petroleum. Contrary
                  to conventional wisdom, ownership risk slows
                  resource use in some circumstances.},

 abstract = {Tropical deforestation accounts for almost one-fifth of
                  greenhouse gas emissions worldwide and threatens the
                  world's most diverse ecosystems. The prevalence of
                  illegal forest extraction in the tropics suggests
                  that understanding the incentives of local
                  bureaucrats and politicians who enforce forest
                  policy may be critical to understanding tropical
                  deforestation. We find support for this thesis using
                  a novel satellite-based dataset that tracks annual
                  changes in forest cover across eight years of
                  institutional change in post-Soeharto
                  Indonesia. Increases in the numbers of political
                  jurisdictions are associated with increased
                  deforestation and with lower prices in local wood
                  markets, consistent with a model of Cournot
                  competition between jurisdictions. Illegal logging
                  increases dramatically in the years leading up to
                  local elections, suggesting the presence of
                  "political logging cycles". And, illegal logging and
                  rents from unevenly distributed oil and gas revenues
                  are short run substitutes, but this effect
                  dissapears over time as political turnover
                  occurs. The results illustrate how incentives faced
                  by local government officials affect deforestation,
                  and provide an example of how standard economic
                  theories can explain illegal behavior.},

                  conceptual and empirical understanding of basic
                  information-theoretic econometric models and
                  methods. Because most data are observational,
                  practitioners work with indirect noisy observations
                  and ill-posed econometric models in the form of
                  stochastic inverse problems. Consequently,
                  traditional econometric methods in many cases are
                  not applicable for answering many of the
                  quantitative questions that analysts wish to
                  ask. After initial chapters deal with parametric and
                  semiparametric linear probability models, the focus
                  turns to solving nonparametric stochastic inverse
                  problems. In succeeding chapters, a family of power
                  divergence measure-likelihood functions are
                  introduced for a range of traditional and
                  nontraditional econometric-model problems. Finally,
                  within either an empirical maximum likelihood or
                  loss context, Ron C. Mittelhammer and George
                  G. Judge suggest a basis for choosing a member of
                  the divergence family.},

                  depends upon dispersal patterns of the resource
                  across space, and only in special circumstances do
                  we find a modified golden rule of growth that is
                  independent of dispersal patterns. We also find that
                  the optimal harvest rule may include closure of some
                  areas to harvest, either on a temporary or permanent
                  basis (biological reserves). Reserves alone cannot

                  spatial heterogeneity and connectivity, increase

                  empirical work on the spatial aspects of the
                  economy--that is, where economic activity occurs and
                  why. Using new tools--in particular, modeling
                  techniques developed to analyze industrial
                  organization, international trade, and economic
                  growth--this \&quot;new economic geography\&quot;
                  has emerged as one of the most exciting areas of
                  contemporary economics. The authors show how
                  seemingly disparate models reflect a few basic
                  themes, and in so doing they develop a common
                  \&quot;grammar\&quot; for discussing a variety of
                  issues. They show how a common approach that
                  emphasizes the three-way interaction among
                  increasing returns, transportation costs, and the
                  movement of productive factors can be applied to a
                  wide range of issues in urban, regional, and
                  international economics. This book is the first to
                  provide a sound and unified explanation of the
                  existence of large economic agglomerations at
                  various spatial scales.},

                  bioinvasion control. We develop a spatially explicit
                  two-dimensional model of species spread that allows
                  for differential control across space and time, and
                  we solve for optimal spatial-dynamic control
                  strategies. We find that the optimal strategies
                  depend in interesting ways on the shape of the
                  landscape and the location, shape, and contiguity of
                  the invasion. For example, changing the shape of the
                  invasion or using landscape features to reduce the
                  extent of exposed invasion edge can be an optimal
                  strategy because it reduces long-term containment
                  costs. We also show that strategies should be
                  targeted to slow or prevent the spread of an
                  invasion in the direction of greatest potential
                  long-term damages. These spatially explicit
                  characterizations of optimal policies contribute to
                  the largely nonspatial literature on controlling
                  invasions and our general understanding of how to
                  control spatial-dynamic processes.},
